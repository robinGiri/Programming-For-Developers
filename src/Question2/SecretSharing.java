/*
I initiate by creating a Set called secretRecipients to store 
those aware of the secret, starting with the initialPerson. 
Simultaneously, I initialize a boolean array, alreadyReceived, to 
track those who have been informed. I iterate through sharingIntervals, 
creating a new Set, newRecipients, for potential recipients within each 
interval. Assessing individuals in the current secret recipients, I 
update newRecipients if they fall within the current interval and 
haven't received the secret. The main set of secret recipients is then 
updated with newRecipients' contents. After iterating through all 
intervals, I return the list of secret recipients as an ArrayList. 
In the main method, I set input parameters, call the 
findSecretRecipients function, and print the result, displaying 
individuals who eventually know the secret.

/*
Example:
Input : totalIndividuals = 5, sharingIntervals = [[0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4]], initialPerson = 0


The sharing intervals are as follows:
[0, 2] : 0 1 2
[1, 3] : 1 2 3
[2, 4] : 2 3 4

Output : 0 1 2 3 4 
Time complexity : O(number of sharing intervals * the total number of individuals)
