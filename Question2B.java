// To solve this problem, we can simulate the secret-sharing process using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach across the time intervals. The idea is to track which individuals know the secret at any given time and then use the intervals to propagate the secret to others. Since the intervals dictate when and between which individuals the secret can be shared, we can incrementally update who knows the secret after each interval.

// Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this in Java:

// Initialize: Start with a Set<Integer> to keep track of individuals who know the secret. Initially, add person 0 to this set.
// Process Intervals: Sort the intervals by their start time. For each interval, check if the person who has the secret is in the set of individuals who know the secret; if so, add the individuals within the range of the interval to this set.
// Repeat Until No Changes: Continue processing the intervals in a loop until no new individuals learn the secret in a full pass through the intervals. This ensures that the secret is shared as far as possible within the given intervals.
// Return the Result: After processing all intervals and no more individuals can learn the secret, return the set of individuals who know the secret.
// Below is the Java code implementing the above approach:

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Question2B {

    public static Set<Integer> findIndividualsWhoKnowSecret(int n, int[][] intervals) {
        // Initially, only person 0 knows the secret
        Set<Integer> knowsSecret = new HashSet<>();
        knowsSecret.add(0);
        
        boolean changed = true;
        // Repeat until no new individuals learn the secret
        while (changed) {
            changed = false;
            for (int[] interval : intervals) {
                // Check if any person in the interval knows the secret
                boolean intervalHasSecret = false;
                for (int i = interval[0]; i <= interval[1]; i++) {
                    if (knowsSecret.contains(i)) {
                        intervalHasSecret = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                // If someone in the interval knows the secret, share it with everyone in the interval
                if (intervalHasSecret) {
                    for (int i = interval[0]; i <= interval[1]; i++) {
                        // If this person didn't know the secret before, mark that the set changed
                        if (!knowsSecret.contains(i)) {
                            knowsSecret.add(i);
                            changed = true;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return knowsSecret;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;
        int[][] intervals = {{0, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 4}};
        Set<Integer> individualsWhoKnowSecret = findIndividualsWhoKnowSecret(n, intervals);
        System.out.println(individualsWhoKnowSecret);
    }
}
// This code defines a method findIndividualsWhoKnowSecret that determines which individuals will eventually know the secret, given the number of individuals n and a set of secret-sharing intervals. The approach ensures that the secret is propagated to as many individuals as possible based on the intervals provided.
